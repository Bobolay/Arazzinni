    | – Earlier this year, Marvin Windows and Doors introduced the Clad Ultimate Multi-Slide Door to its Scenic Door collection, which answered the marketplace’s demand for large doors that maximize daylight and views. Now, to further enhance that product introduction, and to help provide greater comfort and protection against insects and the elements, Marvin introduces a sliding screen door option for the Clad Ultimate Multi-Slide Door.
  p.regular-big Marvin’s news sliding screens are available up to 12’ wide with a single screen and 24’ wide with double screens, both of which fit seamlessly into Marvin’s large Multi-Slide Doors. The screen retracts neatly away, so it is not visible when not in use. Other features of this screen option include:
